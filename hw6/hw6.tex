\begin{enumerate}

\item  In a fully balanced (symmetric) binary search tree (BST) with $n$ nodes, the root has rank $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$. Given a BST that is a valid red-black tree, how extreme (e.g., how low) could the rank of the root be?  Use $\Theta$-notation for your answer, otherwise lower order terms may become annoying. Include a description or drawing of a tree that corresponds to your answer (in other words explain how you're getting your answer).

The height in a red-black tree is at most $2\log n$.  

It is easy to calculate the rank of the root because its just the size of each subtree + 1.

The best-case scenario for a subtree is always a subtree of height $2 \log n -1$ (because we can't go up 2 levels or the tree wouldn't be balanced).

That means that the lowest rank the root can have is the size of that subtree + 1.

The number of nodes in a tree of size $2 \log n - 1$ is $2^{2\log n} + 1$

This means that the lowest rank for the root node is $\Theta(\sqrt n)$.
