\begin{enumerate}

 \item Design any polynomial-time algorithm to get a LCS (not just the length of the LCS) of two strings of length $n$, using $O(n)$ space.\\\\\\\\\\\\
 
  In polynomial time is fairly straightforward, as we can simply scan over each character of the first string, 
  and attempt to run a parallel scan on each character of the second string. This is polynomial time because it will have to run 1 scan per
  character in the second string (n scans), as well as 1 scan per character in the first (so n scans n times is $n^2$).

  This is $O(n)$ space because we only store the longest string and the string we're currently looking at. This is worst case $2n - 1$ which is still $O(n)$.
